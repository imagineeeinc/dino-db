<h3 align="center">ðŸ¦•A small, document-oriented data baseðŸ¦•</h3>

Dino DB is a light yet robust Database for portable and server applications. A document-oriented based on the design of [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

There are separate modules you can add to enhance your usage of DinoDB. There is a server extension which allows you to access the Database from external applications with http requests, there is also a cross platform client which adds a clean api to make requests to your database.

# Install
```shell
# npm
npm i dino-db
```
```js
// node
const dinoBb = require('dino');

// browser (skypack)
import * as dinoDb from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/dino-db'
// browser module bundler
import * as dinoDb from 'dino-db'
```

Check out on how to expose your database to external apps with the [server extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dino-db-server).

Then check out on how to connect to the database with the [JavaScript based client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dino-db-client)
# Usage
